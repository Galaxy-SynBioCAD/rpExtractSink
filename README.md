# rpExtractSink

* Docker image: [brsynth/rpextractsink-standalone](https://hub.docker.com/r/brsynth/rpextractsink-standalone)

Tool that takes for input an SBML file and uses the MIRIAM annotations of the chemical species within a given compartment to find their InChI structures. Performs FVA to remove dead end metabolites. The output is a CSV RetroPath2.0 friendly CSV file that can be used as sink input. 

## Input

Required:
* **-input_sbml**: (string) Path to the input SBML file

Addtional information:
* **-remove_dead_end**: (boolean, default: True) Perform FVA evaluation to remove dead end metabolites
* **-compartment_id**: (string, default: MNXC3) Specify the compartment from which to extract the sink molecules. The default are for MetaNetX files

## Output

* **-output_sink**: (string) Path to the output csv file

## Installing

To compile the docker use the following command:

```
docker build -t brsynth/rpextractsink-rest:dev .
```

To run the service as localhost, use the following command:

```
docker run -p 8888:8888 brsynth/rpextractsink-rest:dev
```

### Running the test

To run the test, run the following command:

```
python tool_rpExtractSink.py -input test/e_coli_model.sbml -output test/test_rpExtractSink.csv
```
