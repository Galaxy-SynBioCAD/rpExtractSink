# rpExtractSink docker

* Docker image: [brsynth/rpextractsink-standalone](https://hub.docker.com/r/brsynth/rpextractsink-standalone)

Tool that takes for input an SBML file and uses the MIRIAM annotations of the chemical species within a given compartment to find their InChI structures. Performs FVA to remove dead end metabolites. The output is a CSV RetroPath2.0 friendly CSV file that can be used as sink input. 

## Input

Required:
* **-input_sbml**: (string) Path to the input SBML file

Addtional information:
* **-remove_dead_end**: (boolean, default: True) Perform FVA evaluation to remove dead end metabolites
* **-compartment_id'**: (string, default: MNXC3) Specify the compartment from which to extract the sink molecules. The default are for MetaNetX files

## Output

* **-output_sink**: (string) Path to the output csv file
